# Rising Waters: A Machine Learning Approach to Flood Prediction

An end-to-end Machine Learning web application designed to predict the likelihood of floods using historical weather, precipitation, and cloud visibility parameters. The application assists disaster management authorities and government agencies in identifying flood risks early, enabling timely evacuation planning and efficient resource allocation.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Premium Web UI:** Fully responsive, glassmorphic dark-themed interface built using HTML5, CSS3 (with custom variables and animations), and JavaScript.
*   **Meteorological Inputs:** Evaluate risk levels based on Annual Rainfall (mm), Seasonal Rainfall (mm), Cloud Visibility percentage, and custom Weather Parameter Index.
*   **Predictive ML Layer:** Compares four classification models trained on a custom clean dataset:
    *   **Random Forest Classifier** (Best Performer: **90.25% Accuracy**)
    *   **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** (89.75% Accuracy)
    *   **XGBoost Classifier** (88.00% Accuracy)
    *   **Decision Tree Classifier** (84.75% Accuracy)
*   **Auto Model Selector:** The pipeline automatically selects and saves the highest-accuracy model for web application inference.
*   **Prediction Session History:** Displays a dynamic history log of recent calculations performed during the session.
*   **Robust Input Validation:** Server-side and client-side checks ensure high data entry integrity.

## ☁️ Deployment Readiness (IBM Cloud)

This project is prepared with the necessary structures for seamless deployment to IBM Cloud Foundry or Code Engine:
*   **`Procfile`**: Specifies the process command: `web: gunicorn app:app`
*   **`runtime.txt`**: Declares the Python execution version.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: Includes production-grade WSGI server (`gunicorn`).

## 📈 ML Pipeline & Preprocessing Details

*   **Handling Missing Values:** Missing weather features were imputed using column-wise median values.
*   **Duplicate Records:** 15 identical rows were dropped to prevent overfitting.
*   **Outlier Treatment:** Capped extreme outliers at the $1.5 \times \text{IQR}$ bounds to maintain the data variance structure while smoothing noise.
*   **Scaling:** Features are scaled using `StandardScaler` to ensure optimal performance for K-Nearest Neighbors and tree model conversions.
